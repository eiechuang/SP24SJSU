To run these files, make sure that they are all contained in the Htdocs file of XAMPP, otherwise the files 
will be run from your file manager; not compiling the php code and instead printing it. In addition, 
make sure the localhost servers are running from xampp control panel.

Once there, run either Registration.html or adminaccess.html in order to view the login text boxes.
Admin access is for verifying the login and pw contents of my database, Registration is for entering new
entries into the database.
