    <!-- 
    DAY ONE
- simple form in an HTML file named Registration.html
- 2 text entry boxes and labels to accept an userid and password

- Have a button named “Register” and it will trigger the insertion of data to the database

    DAY TWO
- After the data is inserted successfully, you should be able to login using the newly stored info
- Use PHP to insert and query the data from the server
- Have another form similar to the one shown in class/video to use the newly created ID and
PW to validate your registration data. If login is successful, display “Success”, else “Failed”.
- Disallow duplicate user name in the user table.-->
